Proposed subproblems:

- What tasks should be performed by officers stationed

- Which (external) data is the most important in making the prediction

- What parameters should be taken into account when making the prediction about risk factor

- How should we define and calculate risk factor

- How should the risk factor be connected to available police resources

- To what do we assign the risk factor
